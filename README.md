# challenge1-refactoring-code


## Description

The motivation of this project is to make this website user friendly for all users, and consolidate redundancy in the code. I built this code to enhance my technical abilites in CSS and HTML by using semantic elements in the HTML and consolidating the CSS code portions. This code solved the problem of accessability for users on the website. Also by creating a DRY CSS code. My biggest lesson from this project is to check the website after each update. I tried to update many lines of code and then check my website, this was difficult to find where the bug was in the code.
